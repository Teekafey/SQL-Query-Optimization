# SQL-Query-Optimization


SQL query optimization refers to the process of ensuring your queries are running efficiently, resulting in reduced load times, less resource consumption, and higher performance of your database. Optimizing SQL queries also helps data teams identify and improve poor query performance. It can be an iterative process sometimes.

I was working on optimizing queries and ran into one of the worst SQL queries possible. 

The dataset? **Over 100K rows**.

💭 The goal? Take this query from *__super slow__* to **lightning fast**! ⚡

## 🚨 Step 1: The “Unoptimized” Query

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM fifa21 a
INNER JOIN [fifa22 b
ON a.RowNum = b.RowNum
WHERE LOWER(a.Nationality) = 'england'
AND a.Club LIKE '%manches%';
```
### ❌ Problems:

SELECT * → Fetching all columns (high I/O).

LOWER(Nationality) = ‘england’ → Breaks indexing, causing a full table scan.

LIKE ‘%manches%’ → Wildcard search prevents index usage, leading to another table scan.

💡 Hint: Table SEEK > Table SCAN



## 🚀 Step 2: Optimize Column Selection

```SQL
SELECT a.ID, a.Name, a.Age, a.Nationality, a.Club, b.Club AS Fifa22_Club
FROM fifa21 a
INNER JOIN fifa22 b
ON a.RowNum = b.RowNum
WHERE LOWER(a.Nationality) = 'england'
AND a.Club LIKE '%manches%';
```

✅ **Solution:** Select only the necessary columns.

🚀 **Result:** Less memory usage, improved performance.
